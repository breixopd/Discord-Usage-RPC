# Discord Usage RPC

A customizable Discord RPC that shows CPU and RAM usage. Made using [pypresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence)

## Installation
Download files and make an RPC [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) (check Discord docs for how to add images, you can find them [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/rpc))

## Usage
Edit [the config file example](https://github.com/breixopd/Discord-Usage-RPC/blob/main/config_example.json) with the details for your RPC.
Rename `config_example.json` to `config.json` and put it in the same directory as the python files or `main.exe`.
Run `main.py` or `main.exe`. You can run `main.py` through an interpreter like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or do: 
```bash
python3 main.py
```
In your command line
